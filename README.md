Description:
This Wordle Game is a Python-based implementation of the classic word-guessing game using the Pygame library. Players aim to discover a hidden word by entering letters through the keyboard, and receiving immediate feedback on the correctness of their guesses. The game features a visually appealing interface with background images and custom fonts. This is my CISC179 Github Project and was assisted trhough baraltech's youtube video.


Features:
The program initializes the Pygame library, sets up the game window with background and icon, and defines a hidden word (e.g., "coder") for players to guess. Users interact with the game by entering letters, which are visually displayed on the screen. The game checks the correctness of each guess, updates the display accordingly, and tracks the number of attempts.

User Interaction:
Players can input letters, delete the last entered letter, and trigger a play-again option upon winning or losing. The game's graphical interface includes indicators for available letters on the keyboard, enhancing the user experience.

Outcome:
The Wordle Game concludes with a win if the correct word is guessed within a set number of attempts (six)  and declares a loss if the maximum attempts are reached without a correct guess.

Intended Functionality:
Designed for simplicity and enjoyment, this Wordle Game provides an interactive platform for users to test their word-guessing skills.
